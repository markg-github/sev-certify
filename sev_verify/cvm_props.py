"""Shared callables for ID block generation in sev_verify test modules.

A test module that requires an ID block includes these steps in its steps()
list, in order, before vm_launch:

    Step.for_callable(name="Calculate measurement", type="setup",
                      handler="calculate_measurement", timeout=60),
    Step.for_callable(name="Generate ID block", type="setup",
                      handler="generate_id_block", timeout=30),

The calculate_measurement step writes guest_measurement.txt to ctx.artifact_dir.
The generate_id_block step reads it, generates ephemeral P-384 key pairs, calls
snpguest to produce id-block.b64 and id-auth.b64, and updates ctx.profile so
that the subsequent vm_launch step passes the ID block to QEMU.

Both steps follow the additive principle: if OVMF is absent (no measurement
possible), calculate_measurement returns a non-zero exit code and — because it
is typed "setup" — the remaining steps are skipped cleanly.
